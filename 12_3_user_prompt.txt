<Task Overview>
In this task, you will classify student utterances from a mathematics classroom transcript. You will be given a list of dialogue utterances. Each utterance is formatted as <uttid>:<utterance text>. Your goal is to categorize each target utterance (<Target Utterance>) based on the following label according to the label definitions provided below. Choose the label that best matches the **content and intent** of the utterance, even if the utterance is partial, unclear, or contains errors.


You must output in strict **JSON format** the annotations for all <uttid>.


Be accurate and consistent:
- Only use labels from the provided list.
- Do not invent new labels.
- If unsure, choose the label that most closely matches based on provided examples.
- Minor grammatical mistakes or incomplete sentences should not change the intent.


Please carefully review the context rows (Backward Context and Forward Context)  around the target row (<Target Utterance>), if the context rows clearly indicate that the conversation relates to a certain label but the <Target Utterance> is ambiguous, assign that row the label from the rest of the conversation. Only assign it a different label if it clearly belongs to a different feature. 


Previous LLMs doing this prompt had very high recall but very low precision. Please keep this very much in mind when you make your predictions and be *very* careful not to over-predict the number of class=1 values.

### Backward Context (Utterances Immediately Preceding Target) ###
{bwd_context}


<Target Utterance>
Format the output as JSON with the <uttid> as keys.
Utterances:
{dialogue}
</Target Utterance>


### Forward Context (Utterances Immediately Following Target) ###
