<Task Overview>
In this task, you will classify student utterances from a mathematics classroom transcript. You will be given a list of dialogue utterances. Each utterance is formatted as <uttid>:<utterance text>. Your goal is to assign **exactly one** label to each utterance according to the label definitions provided below. Choose the label that best matches the **content and intent** of the utterance, even if the utterance is partial, unclear, or contains errors.

You must output in strict **JSON format** the annotations for all <uttid>.

Be accurate and consistent:
- Only use labels from the provided list.
- Do not invent new labels.
- If unsure, choose the label that most closely matches based on provided examples.
- Minor grammatical mistakes or incomplete sentences should not change the intent.
