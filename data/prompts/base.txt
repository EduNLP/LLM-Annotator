<Task Overview>
In this task, you will classify student utterances from a mathematics classroom transcript. You will be given a list of dialogue utterances. Each utterance is formatted as <uttid>:<utterance text>. Your goal is to assign **exactly one** label to each utterance according to the label definitions provided below. Choose the label that best matches the **content and intent** of the utterance, even if the utterance is partial, unclear, or contains errors.

You must output in strict **JSON format** the annotations for all <uttid>.

Be accurate and consistent:
- Only use labels from the provided list.
- Do not invent new labels.
- If unsure, choose the label that most closely matches based on provided examples.
- Minor grammatical mistakes or incomplete sentences should not change the intent.

Please carefully review the context rows around the target row, if the context rows clearly indicate that the conversation relates to a certain feature but the specific row that you are labeling is ambigious, label that row with the feature from the rest of the conversation. Only label it with a different feature if it clearly belongs to a different feature. 

**CRITICAL CONDITIONAL INSTRUCTION:**
If and only if the feature you are currently labeling is **"Directions"**:
1.  For each <uttid>, extract the **session number** by taking the digits *before the first underscore* without the leading zero(s) (e.g., in "016_45", the session number is "16" not "016" and in "001_05" the session number is "1" not "001" or "01").
2.  Use that session number to look up the corresponding **Curriculum Context** in the Curriculum Context Dictionary below (the keys of this dictionary are session numbers and the values of this dictionary are the corresponding **Curriculum Context**).
3.  This is the directions feature definition: "Reading or discussing how to make sense of the task prompt, question, or what they are being asked to do by the written task and/or by the teacher framing the task. Does not include: talk about how to solve a particular problem." The **Curriculum Context** is the actual, student-facing "task prompt, question, or what they are being asked to do by the written task and/or by the teacher" that the Directions feature definition references. Thus the **Curriculum Context** is absolutely critical context to determine if students are "Reading or discussing how to make sense of the task prompt, question, or what they are being asked to do by the written task and/or by the teacher framing the task." and  the **Curriculum Context**  should be carefully considered when annotating for the **"Directions"** feature. Recall that the "Directions" feature "Does not include: talk about how to solve a particular problem." meaning talking about how to solve a particular problem that appears in the **Curriculum Context** does NOT count as "Directions". 
4. Previous LLM models just followed steps 1-3 and had very high recall but very low precision because the models failed to carefully discern the difference between talking about how to solve problems/discussing answers/discussing how to present answers (all of which are NOT directions), and Reading or discussing how to make sense of the task directions (aka what they are being asked to do) (which IS directions). The goal is to identify instances of students reading/dicussing the task directions (AKA reading/discussing WHAT they are supposed to do), NOT instances where students are not talking about the mechanics of task itself and instead are working to figure out how to complete it (AKA reading/discussing HOW they are doing what they are supposed to do). Previous LLM models captured most of the true "Directions" utterances, but had many false positives because they did not carefully evaluate this distinction.

This lesson ends with an\nopportunity for students to practice calculating the total after two percentages are applied (e.g., a\ndiscount followed by sales tax).\n\nLesson Summary Warm-Up (5 minutes) The purpose of the warm-up is to introduce students to the concept of sales tax. Activity 1: Tax and Tip (30 minutes) The purpose of this activity is for students to apply what they\'ve learned to calculate the total\namount in situations that involve multiple percent increases or decreases (e.g., sales tax and a\ndiscount). In addition, students write expressions to represent both sales tax and tip.\n\n\nasking students if they have ever had the\nexperience of something costing more than they expected because\nof tax.\n\nHere are two receipts that printed out correctly.which expressions represent the sales tax and what other values,\nsuch as 0.07 and 1.07, represent in this context.I divided the total cost by the price to figure out the constant of\nproportionality, which was 1.07 . The 1 represents 100%, and the 0.07\nrepresents a 7% increase. I divided the change $0.56 by the original price $8.00, which\nwas 0.07 . This as a percent is 7%.\n\nBroken cash register. The sales tax rate is 7%. Determine the remaining values for these receipts. Soup: Tax $0.35, Total $5.35. Pizza: tax $1.26 total $19.26. Donut: Tax $0.14 Total $2.14, Salad: Tax $0.56 Total 8.56 Sandwhich Tax $0.91 Total 13.91 Tea Tax $0.07 total $1.07. \n\nNew Cash Register: The Des-Cafe got a new cash register! Write expressions that the cash register can use to determine the tax\nand the total for any item. Tax 0.07c Total 1.07c \n\nTips Customers at restaurants usually leave a tip for the server. Sometimes, restaurants add an 18% tip to the bill automatically. Complete the table to program the cash register. 18% tip: 0.18T Total with tip 1.18T\n\nCoupon A restaurant offers a 20% off coupon. The tax rate is 7.5%. If an item is listed at $15, how much does it cost after the coupon and\ntax have been applied? $12.90 Explanations vary. To determine the price after the coupon, I\nmultiplied 15 by 0.8 and got 12. Then, to determine the price\nafter tax, I multiplied 12 by 1.075 to get 12.9. \n\nPractice: Find the Total This meal costs $25.00. A 7% sales tax is applied, followed by an 18% tip. What is the total with tax and tip?\n\nAre you ready for more? This meal originally costs $75.00. Fatima used a 20% off coupon and then tax was added. The total after coupon and tax was $75.00. What was the tax rate? 25% I wrote the equation 75*0.8*x=75  and then\nsolved it by dividing. I found that x must be 0.25, which means the\ntax rate is 25%\n\nLesson synthesis: Describe a strategy for calculating the total for any item after a\ndiscount and tax. Use the receipts if they help you with your thinking. First, figure out the subtotal with the discount,\nwhich usually means multiplying by a number less than 1. Then,\nuse the answer that you got to figure out the total with tax. This is\nusually a number greater than 1. Be careful about tax percentages\nlike 6.25%, which can be confusing.\n\nCool down: A meal costs $30 before tax and tip. There is a 7% sales tax. After the tax, a 20% tip is added. What is the total after tax and tip? $38.52\n\n\nThis is the math we wanted you to understand: I can solve multistep problems about sales tax and tip.', 22: 'Warm-Up: Vocabulary Check ✅ Function: Every _______ must have only one _______\n\nInput: \nAlso known as the ________________ variable. \nOn a graph, you can find it on the ____ axis\n\nOutput\nAlso known as the ________________ variable.\nOn a graph, you can find it on the ____ axis\nWord Bank:\nIndependent \nDependent\nFunction\nInput \nOutput\nX\nY\n\n(you will use all words except for one!)\n\nSection 1: Graphs\nDrama club number of members.

They then see diagrams of balanced and unbalanced hangers and think about what must be true and false about the situations. In subsequent activities, students will use the hanger diagrams to develop general strategies for solving equations. Display the photo of socks and ask students, “What do you notice? What do you wonder?\n\nGive students 1 minute to think about the picture. Record their responses for all to see.\n\nThings students may notice:\n\nThere are two pink socks and two blue socks.\nThe socks are clipped to either ends of two clothes hangers. The hangers are hanging from a rod.\nThe hanger holding the pink socks is level; the hanger holding the blue socks is not level. \nThings students may wonder:\n\nWhy is the hanger holding the blue socks not level?\nIs something inside one of the blue socks to make it heavier than the other sock?\nWhat does this picture have to do with math?\n\nIn the two diagrams, all the triangles weigh the same and all the squares weigh the same.\n\nFor each diagram, come up with . . .\n\nOne thing that must be true \nOne thing that could be true\nOne thing that cannot possibly be true \n\n\nAsk students to share some things that must be true, could be true, and cannot possibly be true about the diagrams. Ask them to explain their reasoning. The purpose of this discussion is to understand how the hanger diagrams work. When the diagram is balanced, there is equal weight on each side. For example, since diagram B is balanced, we know that one triangle weighs the same as three squares. When the diagram is unbalanced, one side is heavier than the other. For example, since diagram A is unbalanced, we know that one triangle is heavier than one square. \n\n\nStudents are presented with four hanger diagrams and are asked to match an equation to each hanger. They analyze relationships and find correspondences between the two representations. Then students use the diagrams and equations to find the unknown value in each diagram. This value is a solution of the equation.\n\nDisplay the diagrams and explain that each square labeled with a 1 weighs 1 unit, and each shape labeled with a letter has an unknown weight. Shapes labeled with the same letter have the same weight.\n\nArrange students in groups of 2. Give 5–10 minutes of quiet work time and time to share their responses with a partner, followed by a whole-class discussion.\n\n\nOn each balanced hanger, figures with the same letter have the same weight.\n\nMatch each hanger to an equation. Complete the equation by writing x,y,z or w in the empty box.\n 2 [blank] + 3 = 5\n3 [blank] + 2 = 3 \n6=2[blank]+3\n7=3[blank]+1\n\n\n \nFind the solution to each equation. Use the hanger to explain what the solution means.\nThis activity continues the work of using a balanced hanger to develop strategies for solving equations. Students are presented with balanced hangers and are asked to write equations that represent them. They are then asked to explain how to use the diagrams, and then the equations, to reason about a solution. Students notice the structure of equations and diagrams and find correspondences between them and between solution strategies.\n\n\nHere are some balanced hangers where each piece is labeled with its weight. For each diagram:\n\nWrite an equation.\nExplain how to figure out the weight of a piece labeled with a letter by reasoning about the diagram.\nExplain how to figure out the weight of a piece labeled with a letter by reasoning about the equation.\nInvite students to demonstrate, side by side, how they reasoned with both the diagram and the equation. For example, diagram A can be shown next to the equation 7=3x+1. Cross out a piece representing 1 from each side, and write 7-1 = 3x +1-1, followed by 6=3x. Encircle 3 equal groups on each side, and write 6/3 = 3x/3, followed by 2=x. Repeat for as many diagrams as time allows. If diagrams A and B did not present much of a challenge for students, spend most of the time on diagrams C and D. \n\nDisplay the equation 4x+6=9.2. Ask students to work with their partner to draw a corresponding hanger diagram. Then, one partner solves by reasoning about the equation, the other solves by reasoning about the diagram. Ask students to compare the two strategies and discuss how they are alike and how they are different.\n\nIn this lesson, we worked with two ways to show that two amounts are equal: a balanced hanger and an equation. We can use a balanced hanger to think about steps to finding an unknown amount in an associated equation. \n\nThe hanger shows a total weight of 7 units on one side that is balanced with 3 equal, unknown weights and a 1-unit weight on the other. An equation that represents the relationship is .\n\nBalanced hanger, left side, 7 squares, right side, 3 circles and 1 square.\n\nWe can remove a weight of 1 unit from each side and the hanger will stay balanced. This is the same as subtracting 1 from each side of the equation. \n\nBalanced hanger, and  to the side, an equation.\n\nAn equation for the new balanced hanger is .\n\nBalanced hanger, left side, 6 blue squares, right side, 3 green circles.  To the side, an equation says 6 = 3 x.\n\nSo the hanger will balance with  of the weight on each side: .\n\nBalanced hanger.\n\nThe two sides of the hanger balance with these weights: 6 1-unit weights on one side and 3 weights of unknown size on the other side.\n\nBalanced hanger, left side 2 squares, right side 1 circle.  To the side, an equation says 2 = x.\n\nHere is a concise way to write the steps above:\n\n\n'}
