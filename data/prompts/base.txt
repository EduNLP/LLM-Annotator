<Task Overview>
In this task, you will classify student utterances from a mathematics classroom transcript. You will be given a list of dialogue utterances. Each utterance is formatted as <uttid>:<utterance text>. Your goal is to assign **exactly one** label to each utterance according to the label definitions provided below. Choose the label that best matches the **content and intent** of the utterance, even if the utterance is partial, unclear, or contains errors.

You must output in strict **JSON format** the annotations for all <uttid>.

Be accurate and consistent:
- Only use labels from the provided list.
- Do not invent new labels.
- If unsure, choose the label that most closely matches based on provided examples.
- Minor grammatical mistakes or incomplete sentences should not change the intent.

Please carefully review the context rows around the target row, if the context rows clearly indicate that the conversation relates to a certain feature but the specific row that you are labeling is ambigious, label that row with the feature from the rest of the conversation. Only label it with a different feature if it clearly belongs to a different feature.
